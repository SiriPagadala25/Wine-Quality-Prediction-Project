# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Project

#Description

This project leverages machine learning to predict the quality of red wine based on its physicochemical attributes such as alcohol content, pH, acidity, and sulphates. The main objective is to develop a reliable, interpretable, and accurate prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier, offering a scalable, automated alternative to traditional, subjective sensory evaluation by wine experts.

The approach follows a structured machine learning pipeline — from data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation — to effectively classify wine quality into three categories: Low, Medium, and High.

#Steps We Followed

    Data Cleaning -> Feature Engineering -> Model Training -> Model Tuning -> Evaluation

#Limitations

    📉 Class imbalance: Most wines fall into the "medium" category, which may bias predictions.
    🧪 Missing sensory data: Taste, aroma, and color are not included in the dataset.
    🌍 Limited scope: Model is trained on one dataset and may not generalize to all wine regions or grape varieties.

#Technologies used

    Python, Scikit-learn,Pandas & NumPy,Matplotlib & Seaborn and Jupyter Notebook
